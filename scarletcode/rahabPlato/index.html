		Rahab in the Book of Joshua receives a Makeover, not only as woman, but as metaphor for 
		the Promised Land of the Israelites. I will use "The Many Saints of Newark" and "The Suicide 
		Squad" to show how the artist, an agent of the feminine plane, mythologizes violence for the 
		construction of a metaphor, in order to show how the feminine writer achieved the same in
		the Book of Joshua.	
		</p>
		<p>
		Audre Lorde speaks and writes about how "erotic knowledge empowers, ... becomes a lens through
		which we scrutinize all aspects of our existence, ...".<sup><a href="#audre">1</a></sup>
		</p>
		<p>
		She goes on to say that "pornography and eroticism ..." are "two diametrically opposed 
		uses of the sexual."
		Rahab is referred to in Hebrew as "ish-zonah," or prostitute, in the text. The Septuagint, which
		is an Ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament, uses the word "porne," from which we
		get our word for "pornography," or a "depection of a harlot (prostitute.)"
		When the Second Chapter of the Book of Joshua begins, the very first verse explains that the
		spies sent out by Joshua " ... came into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged there."
		  <pre>
		     And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of 
			 Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, 
			 Go view the land, even Jericho. And they 
			 went, and came into an harlot' house, 
			 named Rahab, and lodged there.
			 -Joshua 2:1 - King James Version
		  </pre>
		</p>
		<p>
		The word for the verb "spy" is "ragal," which can also mean "to tread upon garments which are
		to be washed and cleansed from dirt."
		</p>
		<p>
		The problem with reading this text in any translation from the Hebrew is that much of the intended
		wordplay is lost in translation, as is true with any translation. The pun is that the "agents of
		Divine will" are charged with purging the land, but it is Rahab who purges them. The spies are
		reflected in the men  who chase after them:
		  <pre>
		    But she had brought them up to the roof 
			of the house, and hid them with the stalks 
			of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.7 

			And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto 
			the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after 
			them were gone out, they shut the gate.
			
			-Joshua 2:6-7 -- KJV
		  </pre>
		</p>
		<p>
	    The word for "roof" is "gag," and a roof was flat in Near Eastern cultures and thus is the same concept
		used for the top or surface of a spiritual altar.
		Stalks of flax were used for linen, and threads. Metaphorically, Rahab is brining the masculine onto
		a spiritual plane wherein she can weave a narrative that can make sense to a masculine mind.
		</p>
		<p>
		The Jordan River here represents the power of humanity as experienced in the feminine via sexuality. The
		fords are shallow places where a river or stream may be crossed. The masculine is reflected in the men
		pursuing the would-be spies. 
		</p>
		<p>
		This ford is the delicate balance between the Chaotic and the Ordered, a Dionysian-Apollonian equation,
		whereby Nietzsche claims the greatest insight is gleaned and which is the definition of great art.
		Michael Franzese is a former Mafia boss from New York who is now a born-again Christian. He's claimed
		that the Gangster Life is destructive to families and that he was abnormal when he lived that life.
		However, after watching "The Many Saints of Newark," he wished on his YouTube channel that he still
		lived that life if he ever met David Chase, presumably to whack Chase for his representation of Gangsters
		in that film.
		</p>
		<p>
		In <cite>The Many Saints of Newark</cite>, Dickie Moltisanti represents the masculine. In the Book of Joshua,
		there are men functioning as agents for the King of Jericho who are hunting down Joshua's spies. These men
		are the alpha males, the rulers. Only by way of Rahab are the tables turned, and it is Joshua and his host
		that cause terror to fall upon the King of Jerico and to all the Canaanites throughout Canaan. In a similar 
		vein, Harold McBrayer is a vassal or puppet to Dickie.  
		</p>
		<p>
		Harold is African-American and thus can never hope to be made an equal in the Italian Mob. Yet, Chase 
		blends Harold's position in society with that of Giuseppina. Giuseppina is the Italian feminine form of 
		the Biblical name Joseph, which stems from the primitive root ysp, which means, "YHWH will add," or "God
		will grow." 
		</p>
		<p>
		Giuseppina is Dickie's Italian youthful and beautiful step-mother, whom his elderly father married in Italy.
		Dickie's father is an associate of the Italian Mob and is named "Hollywood Dickie." Giuseppina arouses the
		Erotic in the younger Dickie, whereby Dickie murders his father and takes Giuseppina as his <cite>comare</cite>,
		which is the Mob slang term for "mistress." 
		</p>
		<p>
		As Dickie's <cite>comare</cite>, Giuseppina grows more American, mastering English and becoming an 
		entreprenuer; yet she is still under Dickie's thumb, mirroring the way Harold is Dickie's lackey.
		</p>
		<p>
		Sound and waves of water are used as symbols and images for the feminine divine, or, to use Lorde's concept,
		the Erotic as Power. Sound is used via music, specifically, when Harold hears the revolutionary poets
		of the early 1970's, Chase uses the music of Gil Scott-Heron. Cigarettes are used as a symbol of addiction, but 
		also as a symbol of spirituality. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Harold has sex with Giuseppina after she and Dickie fight; during this scene, Giuseppina and Harold share a 
		cigarette while talking about finding their empowerment through their capacity to make money via a personal
		business.
		</p>
		<p>
		Giuseppina, however, returns to Dickie, while Harold wages a war against him. Ultimately, Giuseppina
		is killed by Dickie; here the symbolism of waves of water is used, in that Giuseppina is drowned on the beach
		amid the crashing of waves from the ocean. This scene blends into a scene of a young Tony Soprano listening
		to music waves coming from speakers, which were given to him by Dickie.
		Much later in the David Chase Mob Universe, it's Tony Soprano who kills Dickie's only son, Christopher Moltisanti.
		</p>
		<p>
		In James Gunn's <cite>The Suicide Squad</cite>, a woman is made over into a bride only to jest at the whole 
		institution of marriage when she kills the would-be groom. Similarly, in the Book of Joshua, the Feminine
		Power behind this narrative subverts the taboo held against Sexuality by the Deuteronomistic writers that 
		dominate the Book of Joshua. Christine Hayes shows that multiple writers had a hand in the composition
		of the Book of Joshua <sup><a href="#hayes">4</a></sup>
		</p>
		<p>
		Hayes also explains how the same thing that causes us to laugh can also cause us to despair and become uneasy.
		Through the character of Harley Quinn, we laugh at notions of marriage, an institution which must be 
		officiated by a priest or bureaucratic official. Hayes also reads from <cite>Priest and Jester</cite> by 
		Leszek Kolakowski. The jester mistrusts the ordered pretense, and her weapon against is ridicule which 
		arouses laughter; the jester doesn't ridicule gratuitously; she ridicules because there is insight in that
		that which purports to know absolute truth is a ultimately always rests on a  paradox, for there is not absolute truth.
		</p>
		<p>
		The ultimate paradox here is that the Book of Joshua, written by writers who harkened to the Laws against Sexuality
		to make sense of their captivity in Babylon, is threaded by a harlot.
		</p>
		<p>
		Judith Butler says in an interview that "... we don't want a world in which we go back to being an invulnerable 
		individual; I think that's a masculinist model and a very dangerous one on its own." <sup><a href="#butler">5</a></sup>
		Plato lived 400 B.C."

		</p>
		<p>
		In addition to color, dogs are used to re-imagine the sexist slur for an empowered woman; but whereas a female dog is 
		appropriated.
